POINTS (pointless)

core idea: 
- tug of war between 4 floors, 
- 4 controllers on each floor, 
- every button on every controller gives a point to the floor, 
- every floor has a cumulative score, 
- lots of activity in a short period yields a stimulus reward (visual/audial)
- 

fx:
- when you get a point, the last number sheds off and tumbles unto infinity
